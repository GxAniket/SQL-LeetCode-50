🧠 Problem Summary
You’re given a table World with these columns:
name
continent
area
population
gdp

A country is considered big if:
area ≥ 3,000,000 OR
population ≥ 25,000,000

You need to return:
👉 name, population, area of all big countries.

🧪 Example Logic

If a country has:
Area = 5,000,000 but population = 10,000,000 → ✅ included
Area = 1,000,000 but population = 30,000,000 → ✅ included
Area = 1,000,000 and population = 5,000,000 → ❌ not included


-- 595. Big Countries
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000
   OR population >= 25000000;
